Asynchronous Python client for Elgato Key Lights.

## About

This package allows you to control and monitor Elgato Key Light devices
programmatically. It is mainly created to allow third-party programs to automate
the behavior of an Elgato Key Light device.

## Installation

```bash
pip install elgato
```

## Usage

```python
import asyncio

from elgato import Elgato, State, Info


async def main():
    """Show example on controlling your Elgato Key Light device."""
    async with Elgato("elgato-key-light.local") as elgato:
        info: Info = await elgato.info()
        print(info)

        state: State = await elgato.state()
        print(state)

        # Toggle the Key Light
        await elgato.light(on=(not state.on))


if __name__ == "__main__":
    loop = asyncio.get_event_loop()
    loop.run_until_complete(main())
```

## Changelog & Releases

This repository keeps a change log using [GitHub's releases][releases]
functionality. The format of the log is based on
[Keep a Changelog][keepchangelog].

Releases are based on [Semantic Versioning][semver], and use the format
of ``MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH``. In a nutshell, the version will be incremented
based on the following:

- ``MAJOR``: Incompatible or major changes.
- ``MINOR``: Backwards-compatible new features and enhancements.
- ``PATCH``: Backwards-compatible bugfixes and package updates.

## Contributing

This is an active open-source project. We are always open to people who want to
use the code or contribute to it.

We've set up a separate document for our
[contribution guidelines](CONTRIBUTING.md).

Thank you for being involved! :heart_eyes:

## Setting up development environment

In case you'd like to contribute, a `Makefile` has been included to ensure a
quick start.

```bash
make venv
source ./venv/bin/activate
make dev
```

Now you can start developing, run `make` without arguments to get an overview
of all make goals that are available (including description):

```bash
$ make
Asynchronous Python client for Elgato Key Lights.

Usage:
  make help                            Shows this message.
  make dev                             Set up a development environment.
